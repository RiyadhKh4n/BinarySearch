# BinarySearch
This program was a classroom task set by my teacher in July 2020, the objective was to successful code a Binary Search Algorithm and prove that it was faster than a Naïve Search (Linear Search). The code for the Naïve Search are Lines 12 - 17 and for the Binary Search are Lines 23 - 46. In order to highlight which one was more effective (in terms of Time Complexity) I created a randomly generated sorted list of size ten thousands and ran both functions and compared the times for each.  Although simple this program identifies knowledge of Searching Algorithms, Time Complexity, using functions to structure code, use of parameters and iteration.
